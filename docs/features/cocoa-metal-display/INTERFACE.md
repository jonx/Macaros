# cocoametal — the frozen AROS↔host interface (single source of truth)

> Status: **v1 — proposed, freezing in progress** · Drafted 2026-06-25
> Both sides build against *this* file. The host shim (`hosted/cocoametal/`, Apple
> clang, John's independent implementation) and the AROS driver
> (`arch/all-darwin/hidd/cocoa/`, AROS crosstools, mine) meet at exactly one seam:
> **`cocoametal.dylib` + the flat-C `cm_*` ABI in `cocoametal.h`.** Nothing else
> crosses. Any change here is a change to *both* sides and a version bump (§7).

This document freezes three things the design.md left open so D3 (wiring the HIDD
to the shim) becomes pure plumbing:

1. **The symbol list + interface-struct ordering** — the exact load contract.
2. **The pixel / geometry / scale contract.**
3. **The threading + call contract.**

Plus the input ABI (§5) and the readback-oracle rule (§6).

---

## 1. The load sequence (how the AROS side opens the shim)

The AROS driver loads the shim the same way unixio loads libc and the SDL HIDD
loads `libSDL.dylib` — via `hostlib.resource`. Grounded against
`arch/all-unix/hidd/unixio/unixio_class.c:1150-1156`:

```c
HostLibBase = OpenResource("hostlib.resource");          /* once, at driver init */
handle = HostLib_Open("cocoametal.dylib", &errstr);       /* dlopen the shim      */
CMIFace = HostLib_GetInterface(handle, cocoametal_symbols, &errcount);
/* errcount MUST be 0: it counts symbols that failed to resolve. */
```

`HostLib_GetInterface(handle, names[], &errcount)` resolves each name in the
NULL-terminated `names[]` array and returns a struct of function pointers **in the
same order as the array**. This ordering is the contract (see `struct
LibCInterface` mirroring `libc_symbols[]` in `unixio.h:50`). So the array and the
struct below are locked together — append only, never reorder.

### 1a. The frozen symbol array (shared)

Order = `cocoametal.h` declaration order. **Append-only. Never reorder, never
remove.**

```c
static const char *cocoametal_symbols[] =
{
    "cm_open",                     /* 0 */
    "cm_close",                    /* 1 */
    "cm_upload_rect",              /* 2 */
    "cm_present",                  /* 3 */
    "cm_set_effect",               /* 4 */
    "cm_pump_events",              /* 5 */
    "cm_readback",                 /* 6 */
    "cm_target_size",              /* 7 */
    "cm_render_effect_readback",   /* 8 */
    "cm_abi_version",              /* 9 — appended per §7 (append-only) */
    "cm_set_option",               /* 10 — appended at v2 per §9 (append-only) */
    "cm_get_option",               /* 11 — appended at v2 per §9 (append-only) */
    "cm_open_settings",            /* 12 — appended at v2 per §9 (append-only) */
    "cm_set_mode",                 /* 13 — appended at v3 (dynamic display modes) */
    NULL
};
```

### 1b. The AROS-side interface struct (mine — must mirror 1a exactly)

```c
struct CMInterface
{
    struct CMContext *(*cm_open)(int w, int h, const struct CMPixelDesc *fmt, const char *title);
    void              (*cm_close)(struct CMContext *);
    void              (*cm_upload_rect)(struct CMContext *, const void *src, int srcStride, int x, int y, int w, int h);
    void              (*cm_present)(struct CMContext *);
    int               (*cm_set_effect)(struct CMContext *, int effect);
    int               (*cm_pump_events)(struct CMContext *, struct CMEvent *out, int maxEvents);
    int               (*cm_readback)(struct CMContext *, void *dst, int dstStride, int w, int h);
    int               (*cm_target_size)(struct CMContext *, int *outW, int *outH, int *outScale);
    int               (*cm_render_effect_readback)(struct CMContext *, int effect, void *dst, int dstStride, int w, int h);
    int               (*cm_abi_version)(void);   /* entry 9 — appended per §7 */
    int               (*cm_set_option)(struct CMContext *, int key, long value);   /* entry 10 — v2 §9 */
    int               (*cm_get_option)(struct CMContext *, int key, long *value);  /* entry 11 — v2 §9 */
    int               (*cm_open_settings)(struct CMContext *);                     /* entry 12 — v2 §9 */
    int               (*cm_set_mode)(struct CMContext *, int w, int h);             /* entry 13 — v3 */
};
```

### 1c. Host-side build obligation

- Emit a **`cocoametal.dylib`** (not just the D1 test executable).
- Every `cm_*` name above is exported with **default visibility** and **not
  stripped** (`HostLib_GetInterface` resolves them by `dlsym`).
- The dylib pulls **no AROS headers**; the AROS side pulls **no Cocoa headers**.
  `cocoametal.h` is the only shared text (it already holds to this).

## 2. Pixel & geometry contract — FROZEN

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Pixel format | **BGRA8** — blue=byte 0, green 1, red 2, alpha 3 (little-endian AArch64) |
| Bytes/pixel | 4 |
| Origin | top-left |
| Framebuffer owner | **AROS** — `AllocMem(W*H*4, MEMF_CLEAR)`, the H7 model |
| Hand-off | AROS passes a **pointer into the whole framebuffer + `srcStride`** per present; the shim copies the dirty rect (`cm_upload_rect`) |
| What AROS sees | **LOGICAL pixels.** The AROS mode list is in logical WxH. The shim upscales to the backing store via `layer.contentsScale = backingScaleFactor`. |
| Retina/scale | The shim owns scale. `cm_target_size` reports `(backingW, backingH, scale)` **for the readback oracle only** — AROS never reasons in backing pixels. |
| Coords in `cm_*` | **logical (pre-scale)**, top-left origin — applies to `cm_upload_rect`, `cm_readback`, and `CMEvent.x/y`. |

`CMPixelDesc` (from `cocoametal.h`) is passed at `cm_open` and pins the above; the
AROS gfx class advertises exactly one matching TrueColor `vHidd_StdPixFmt_*`.

**Why logical, not backing:** keeps the AROS sync/mode taglists trivial (one mode =
one logical resolution) and keeps the thesis honest — AROS draws a framebuffer it
allocates; the host scales on present. A future `MTLBuffer`-shared zero-copy path
can revisit this without changing the ABI.

---

## 2a. D3 pixel hand-off — the exact `CMPixelDesc` + call mapping — FROZEN

This pins, to the field, what the AROS side passes at `cm_open` for BGRA8 and how
each HIDD method maps onto the `cm_*` ABI, so D3 (rows A–C) is pure plumbing. The
host side has proven this contract end-to-end: `make cocoametal-hiddsim` →
**`[HIDDSIM] PASS`** (the HIDD-shaped behavioral harness — pinned desc, lazy open,
a dirty-rect stream that composes byte-exact vs an independent reference, and a
pixfmt round-trip that catches any swizzle — see §8).

### 2a-1. The exact `CMPixelDesc` (BGRA8 == `MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm`, LE AArch64)

The AROS side fills `cm_open`'s `fmt` with **exactly** these values (any other
value is a contract violation — the host asserts them via the §8 round-trip):

```c
CMPixelDesc fmt = {
    .bytesPerPixel = 4,
    .blueShift  = 0,           .greenShift = 8,           .redShift  = 16,          .alphaShift = 24,
    .blueMask   = 0x000000FF,  .greenMask  = 0x0000FF00,  .redMask   = 0x00FF0000,  .alphaMask  = 0xFF000000,
};
/* In-memory byte order: blue @ byte 0, green @ byte 1, red @ byte 2, alpha @ byte 3. */
```

| Field | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `bytesPerPixel` | `4` | chunky 32-bit |
| `blueShift,greenShift,redShift,alphaShift` | `0, 8, 16, 24` | bit position of each channel in the LE 32-bit word |
| `blueMask,greenMask,redMask,alphaMask` | `0x000000FF, 0x0000FF00, 0x00FF0000, 0xFF000000` | the matching masks |
| Origin | **top-left** | rows top-to-bottom |
| Dimensions | **logical `W×H`** | the AROS mode-list resolution (§2) |

**The AROS-side requirement (THEIR action):** advertise the TrueColor
`vHidd_StdPixFmt_*` whose **in-memory byte order is B, G, R, A** (blue lowest
address) so neither side swizzles — and fill the `CMPixelDesc` above from the
*same* constants. **The AROS side confirms the exact `vHidd_StdPixFmt_*` constant
against `rom/hidds/gfx/include/gfx.h`** (this host spec does not name an AROS enum
it cannot verify). Register that format in the gfx-class `aHidd_Gfx_PixFmtTags`
(`vHidd_ColorModel_TrueColor`, `BytesPerPixel=4`, `BitMapType=…_Chunky`, the
matching `*Shift`/`*Mask`) per spec.md "Pixel format mapping".

### 2a-2. The call-mapping table (HIDD method → `cm_*`)

| AROS HIDD action | `cm_*` call | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `moHidd_Gfx_Show` (first, displayable bitmap front) | **lazy `cm_open(w,h,&fmt,title)`** | open on the FIRST Show, not at class `New` (the SDL lazy-window pattern, §4). Subsequent Shows just select the front bitmap + request a full present. |
| `moHidd_Gfx_CreateObject` (displayable bitmap) | inject **`aHidd_BitMap_ClassPtr`** | hand the base class our bitmap class (mandatory, `gfx_hiddclass.c`). No `cm_*` here — the framebuffer is `AllocMem(W*H*4, MEMF_CLEAR)` in the bitmap class. |
| `moHidd_BitMap_UpdateRect(x,y,w,h)` | **`cm_upload_rect(fb, stride, x,y,w,h)` then `cm_present()`** | the present hook. Pass a pointer to the WHOLE framebuffer + `srcStride`; the shim copies just the dirty sub-rect (§2 hand-off). Many small UpdateRects is the norm — proven to compose byte-exact in `[HIDDSIM]`. |
| VBlank-signalled event task | **`cm_pump_events(out, maxEvents)`** | non-blocking drain (pull, §3/§5); feed the returned `CMEvent[]` into the input subsystem. |
| Unattended verification | **`cm_readback`** (joint acceptance) | the §6 oracle — both sides assert pixels against it, no TCC. |

### 2a-3. The one-time AppKit init (boot task, ONCE — D2t RESOLVED)

Before the first `cm_open`, the display-server / boot task does exactly this pair
(initialization only — **no** run loop, **no** `[NSApp run]`, **no**
`NSApplicationMain`; §3):

```objc
[NSApplication sharedApplication];                              /* create NSApp */
[NSApp setActivationPolicy:NSApplicationActivationPolicyRegular];
```

Run-loop servicing is by hand:
`CFRunLoopRunInMode(kCFRunLoopDefaultMode, 0, true)` (bounded, non-blocking). The
shim's `cm_try_window` performs this same pair idempotently, so omitting it still
works — but the boot task should do it explicitly so the activation policy is set
before any window.

### 2a-4. The live present FILLS the drawable — host-side geometry contract (`[LIVE]`)

The on-screen present is host-side geometry and is **not** part of the `cm_*` ABI,
but it is the part the **user actually looks at**, so it has its own contract and its
own verification marker.

**The contract.** On every frame and across every transition (windowed, live resize,
Retina/scale change, and especially **fullscreen enter/exit**):

1. **The `CAMetalLayer` fills the content view.** The layer is the content view's
   **backing layer** (`CMContentView -makeBackingLayer` returns the `CAMetalLayer`),
   so AppKit autoresizes `layer.frame` to the view bounds, and the view's geometry
   hooks (`-layout` / `-setFrameSize:` / `-viewDidChangeBackingProperties`, plus the
   `windowDidEnterFullScreen:` / `windowDidExitFullScreen:` delegate callbacks)
   recompute `layer.contentsScale` + `layer.drawableSize` from the view's **current
   backing-pixel size**. `cm_present` also resyncs immediately before `nextDrawable`,
   so the live drawable matches the window/screen even if AppKit deferred a `-layout`
   pass under the hand-pumped run loop.
2. **The present scales the framebuffer to fill the drawable, aspect-preserved, with
   a BLACK letterbox.** The default scale mode is **`CM_SCALE_ASPECT_FIT`** (§9b):
   the framebuffer is upscaled to the largest centred rect of the **logical** aspect
   that fits the drawable; the surrounding letterbox/pillarbox is **black**. The
   window + content view backgrounds are black, so **no white ever shows**.

**The bug this fixed (2026-06-25).** The `CAMetalLayer.drawableSize` was set **once**
at `cm_open` and never updated when the content view resized. On a fullscreen enter
the content view grew to fill the screen but the drawable stayed the small windowed
pixel size, so the framebuffer rendered into only a small corner — a **small rect in
a black fullscreen window**, with the view's default (white) background showing
around it. **The offscreen oracle (`cm_readback`) was blind to this**: the oracle
target is rendered full-size and never resized, so it stayed byte-exact while the
live drawable was wrong. Measured before/after (backgrounded CLI; a real foreground
Space is screen-sized): on fullscreen enter `view.backing` 640×400→640×**464** while
`layer.drawableSize` stayed frozen at 640×**400** before the fix; after the fix the
drawable tracks the view (640×**464**).

**Verification — `[LIVE] PASS` (`make cocoametal-livedraw`).** A live-drawable
readback test the oracle could not provide: the TEST build sets the live layer
`framebufferOnly=NO` (production keeps it `YES`), uploads the 4-quadrant + marker
scene, composes it into the live drawable via the **real present pass**, **reads the
live drawable back**, and asserts — **windowed AND after entering fullscreen** — that
(a) `drawable == content-view backing size` (it fills the view), (b) the four
quadrant colours land in the aspect-fit content rect at full drawable size (not a
tiny corner), and (c) every letterbox pixel is **black, never white**. Headless-safe
(skips the live asserts, keeps the §6 oracle). Plus **`make cocoametal-show`** — a
persistent, human-facing build (NOT in the regression matrix): it opens the window,
draws an obvious scene (4 quadrants + a 1px bright-white edge border so edge-fill is
visible + a moving marker), stays windowed a few seconds, then goes fullscreen and
stays so the user can *see* it fill the screen; bounded (auto-exits ~20s or on a
keypress) so it can't hang.

---

## 3. Threading & call contract — FROZEN

This is the design.md "main-thread crux", pinned so D2 proves the *real* model.

- **Single caller.** Every `cm_*` is called from the **one AROS scheduler thread**
  (`[OURS]` H6), serialized under **`HostLib_Lock()` / `HostLib_Unlock()`**, across
  the **`abishim.S`** AAPCS64↔Apple-arm64 boundary (16-byte SP alignment — H3). No
  `cm_*` is ever called from two threads.
- **No callbacks into AROS.** The shim **never** calls an AROS LVO and **never**
  raises an AROS `Signal`. Input flows *only* by the AROS side calling
  `cm_pump_events` and reading the returned `CMEvent[]` (pull, not push). This is
  why cocoametal needs **no** `host-wake` seam (contrast the socket/clipboard/audio
  drivers).
- **No `NSApplicationMain` / no `[NSApp run]`.** The AROS boot task *is* the host
  main pthread (H4); it drives `CFRunLoopRunInMode(kCFRunLoopDefaultMode, 0, true)`
  by hand. **D2 must open the window, present, and pump under this exact model** —
  not a harness that spins `NSApp`. If any call needs the app run loop, we find out
  at D2.

  **D2 RESOLVED (`[D2t]` green — `hosted/cocoametal/d2t_test.m`, this Mac: M5 /
  macOS 26.5).** Under exactly this model (main pthread, hand-pumped
  `CFRunLoopRunInMode(kCFRunLoopDefaultMode, 0, true)`, never `[NSApp run]`):
  - **The minimal AppKit init the boot task must do ONCE, before the first
    `cm_open`:**
    ```objc
    [NSApplication sharedApplication];                 /* create NSApp */
    [NSApp setActivationPolicy:NSApplicationActivationPolicyRegular];
    ```
    This is *initialization only* — it does **not** start a run loop (`[NSApp
    isRunning]` stays 0). No `finishLaunching`, no `run`, no `NSApplicationMain`.
    (The shim's `cm_try_window` already performs this same pair idempotently, so if
    the boot task omits it the first `cm_open` still establishes it — but the boot
    task should do it explicitly so the activation policy is set before any window.)
  - **`cm_open` (NSWindow + CAMetalLayer creation): WORKS** under the hand-pumped
    model — the window is created and `cm_target_size` reports the real backing
    scale (2× here).
  - **`cm_present` (`[layer nextDrawable]`): WORKS** — every present acquired a
    live `CAMetalDrawable` (3/3 at both 320×200 and 640×512). The hand-pumped
    `CFRunLoopRunInMode(...,0,true)` between presents is sufficient for the window
    server; **no app run loop is required** for `nextDrawable` to yield.
  - **The offscreen oracle (`cm_readback`) PASSES** at both resolutions regardless
    — it never depends on the window, so even a future headless context (no window
    server → `cm_open` gives a context with `scale=1` and the present pass is
    skipped) keeps the contract.
  - **Caveat:** verified in a GUI login session (a window server was reachable). A
    truly headless launch context (e.g. a bare `launchd` daemon with no session)
    degrades `cm_open` to the headless `scale=1` path; the oracle still holds. The
    graft's display-server task runs in the user's session, matching this.
- **No `cm_*` may block or spin.** `cm_pump_events` is a non-blocking drain;
  `cm_present` is synchronous but bounded (commit + `waitUntilCompleted` on the
  oracle pass only). A `cm_*` that could block must be documented here first.

---

## 4. Function semantics (the parts AROS depends on)

- `cm_open(w, h, fmt, title)` → `CMContext*` or NULL. Builds device/queue,
  framebuffer + offscreen oracle textures, best-effort live window. Called lazily
  on first `moHidd_Gfx_Show` (the SDL lazy-window pattern).
- `cm_upload_rect(ctx, src, srcStride, x, y, w, h)` — copy a logical sub-rect from
  the AROS framebuffer into the GPU texture. Driven by `moHidd_BitMap_UpdateRect`.
- `cm_present(ctx)` — render framebuffer texture → offscreen oracle (pass-through)
  then best-effort present to the drawable. Applies the selected `CMEffect` to the
  *presented* image only; the oracle target stays pass-through.
- `cm_pump_events(ctx, out, maxEvents)` → count written. Drains pending NSEvents.
  Driven by the VBlank-signalled event task. **REAL since D4/D5** (was the D1 stub) —
  non-blocking `nextEventMatchingMask:untilDate:distantPast dequeue:YES` loop bounded by
  `maxEvents`; mapping in §5.
- `cm_readback(ctx, dst, dstStride, w, h)` → 0 on success. Copies the last-presented
  **oracle** target as BGRA8 at logical w×h. **The unattended oracle (§6).**
- `cm_target_size`, `cm_set_effect`, `cm_render_effect_readback` — oracle/effect
  introspection; not on the boot-critical path.

---

## 5. Input ABI — FROZEN

`CMEvent` (from `cocoametal.h`): `{ type, x, y, code, pressed, mods }`.

- `type` ∈ `CM_EV_{NONE,MOUSEMOVE,MOUSEBTN,KEY,CLOSE,RESIZE,SETTING,WHEEL}`.
  `CM_EV_SETTING` is appended at v2 (after `CM_EV_RESIZE`, append-only) — a
  user-changed AROS-facing option, surfaced for pull. Packing in §9.
  `CM_EV_WHEEL` is appended after `CM_EV_SETTING` (append-only, ABI stays 2 —
  an older driver ignores the unknown type): scroll-wheel motion quantized to
  whole line steps.
- `x, y` — **logical** pixel coords, top-left origin. (For `CM_EV_SETTING`,
  `x`/`y` instead carry the option value(s) — see §9. For `CM_EV_WHEEL`,
  `x`/`y` carry the step counts: `x` > 0 = wheel right, `y` > 0 = wheel down —
  the AROS NewMouse/gameport sign convention; the pointer position travels on
  the surrounding `CM_EV_MOUSEMOVE` stream instead.)
- `code` — for `CM_EV_KEY`: the **macOS virtual keycode**; for `CM_EV_MOUSEBTN`:
  button index.
- `pressed` — 1=down, 0=up.
- `mods` — `CM_MOD_{SHIFT,CONTROL,ALT,CMD}` bitmask from `NSEvent.modifierFlags`.

**Keycode → AROS rawkey:** my kbd hardware-driver class needs the
macOS-VK→AROS-rawkey map. Source to adapt:
`../aros-upstream/arch/all-hosted/hidd/x11/mac-x11-keycode2rawkey.table`.
**Action (John):** drop an adapted copy as
`docs/features/cocoa-metal-display/keycode2rawkey.table` so my input class includes

## 6. The readback oracle is the verification contract — FROZEN

`cm_readback` is how **both** sides verify unattended — no `screencapture`, no TCC
prompt. Rules:

- The **offscreen oracle target is always pass-through/nearest**; `CMEffect`
  changes only the *presented* drawable, never the oracle.
- Every new shim behaviour ships with a `cm_readback` (or
  `cm_render_effect_readback`) assertion in a host test.
- When I wire D3, the same oracle re-verifies the scene *after a sequence of real
  `HIDD_BM_*` calls* — so the contract carries from host spike to AROS path
  unchanged.
- **The oracle is necessary but not sufficient for the on-screen present.** The
  oracle target is rendered full-size and is **never resized**, so it stays
  byte-exact even when the **live drawable** geometry is wrong. A user-reported
  fullscreen bug (content shown as a small rect, white surround) was invisible to the
  oracle — it is the **live-drawable readback** (`[LIVE]`, §2a-4: `framebufferOnly=NO`
  + read the live drawable back, assert it fills) that catches on-screen geometry.

---

## 7. Versioning — proposed (needs a one-line header change)

So a stale dylib can't silently mismatch the loader, `cocoametal.h` carries:

```c
#define CM_ABI_VERSION 3          /* bump on ANY breaking change to this contract */
int cm_abi_version(void);          /* returns CM_ABI_VERSION; symbol-list entry 9 */
```

The AROS loader checks `CMIFace->cm_abi_version() == CM_ABI_VERSION` right after
`HostLib_GetInterface` and refuses to register the driver on mismatch. Append-only
rule (§1a) means adding `cm_abi_version` goes at the **end** of the array/struct.

**v1 → v2 (2026-06-25, John — `[SET]` green).** The settings/options ABI (§9) was
**appended**: `cm_set_option`/`cm_get_option`/`cm_open_settings` (symbol entries
10/11/12, after `cm_abi_version` at 9), the `CMOption`/`CMScaleMode`/`CMFilter`
enums, and the `CM_EV_SETTING` event (after `CM_EV_RESIZE`). **All append-only —
no existing symbol or enum member moved.** The bump is conservative (it is purely
additive, so a v1 loader against a v2 dylib would still resolve all v1 symbols),
but the version gate is the contract: an AROS side compiled for one version must
not bind a dylib built for the other without an explicit decision. `[ABI]` now
asserts `cm_abi_version() == 2` with 13 names resolving, errcount 0.

## 8. Split & status checklist

| # | Deliverable | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `cocoametal.dylib` (dlopen-loadable, `cm_*` exported) | John | ✅ `make cocoametal-dylib` → `build/cocoametal.dylib`; 13 `cm_*` exported default-visibility (via `cocoametal.exports`; +3 at v2: `cm_set_option`/`cm_get_option`/`cm_open_settings`), unstripped, ad-hoc signed; test `.m` files NOT in it; no AROS headers |
| 2 | **dlopen-based ABI conformance test** (open→upload→present→readback→pump→close, asserts oracle) | John | ✅ `make cocoametal-abi` → `[ABI] PASS` (errcount=0, all 13 dlsym'd, `cm_abi_version()==2`, §6 oracle quadrants+marker exact, option round-trip + open_settings sane) — `hosted/cocoametal/abi_test.c` |
| 3 | D2 under the **real threading model** (main pthread, manual CFRunLoop, no NSApplicationMain) | John | ✅ `make cocoametal-d2t` → `[D2t] PASS`; window + `nextDrawable` WORK hand-pumped, oracle exact at 320×200 + 640×512 — finding in §3 — `hosted/cocoametal/d2t_test.m` |
| 4 | Pixel/geometry/scale frozen (§2) | both | ✅ frozen here (BGRA8, logical px, scale via contentsScale) |
| 5 | `keycode2rawkey.table` adapted into the feature folder | John | ✅ — `docs/features/cocoa-metal-display/keycode2rawkey.table` (102 rows; left = `CMEvent.code` macOS VK, right = `RAWKEY_*`; see §5 note) |
| 6 | `CM_ABI_VERSION` + `cm_abi_version()` in the header (§7) | John | ✅ `#define CM_ABI_VERSION 2` (v1→v2 at the settings ABI) + `int cm_abi_version(void)` in `cocoametal.h`; implemented in `cocoametal.m`; symbol-array entry 9 (append-only) |
| 7 | **Settings panel + key/value option ABI (§9)** — `cm_set_option`/`cm_get_option`/`cm_open_settings` (entries 10/11/12), `CM_EV_SETTING`, host-acted vs AROS-pull split, `NSUserDefaults` persistence | John | ✅ `make cocoametal-settings` → `[SET] PASS`; host-owned option acts on the live present (oracle unchanged), AROS-facing key surfaces as `CM_EV_SETTING`, `NSUserDefaults` round-trips — `hosted/cocoametal/cocoametal_settings.m` + `settings_test.m`. ABI v2; `[ABI] PASS` now 13 symbols / `cm_abi_version()==2` |
| 8 | **D3 host-support: pixfmt pinned (§2a) + HIDD-shaped harness green** | John | ✅ §2a pins the exact `CMPixelDesc` + call-mapping table; `make cocoametal-hiddsim` → `[HIDDSIM] PASS` — dlopens `build/cocoametal.dylib` (real boundary), AROS-owned framebuffer, lazy `cm_open` on first Show, a dirty-rect stream of partial/overlapping `cm_upload_rect`+`cm_present` composes **byte-exact** vs an independent host reference (256000 B), and a known-pixel round-trip proves B@0/G@1/R@2/A@3 with no swizzle — `hosted/cocoametal/hiddsim_test.c`. Additive (no ABI change). |
| 9 | **`CM_OPT_FULLSCREEN` REAL native AppKit fullscreen (§9f)** — `toggleFullScreen:` enter/exit (no longer a stored-flag stub), oracle byte-exact across the transition, the hand-pumped-`toggleFullScreen:` finding documented | John | ✅ `make cocoametal-fullscreen` → `[FS] PASS`; `cm_set_option(CM_OPT_FULLSCREEN,1/0)` enters/exits real native fullscreen, asserted programmatically via `styleMask & NSWindowStyleMaskFullScreen` (not a screencapture); §6 oracle byte-exact while fullscreen AND windowed; **ENTER completes hand-pumped, EXIT needs the app run loop** (§9f) — `hosted/cocoametal/fullscreen_test.m` + the `cm__set_fullscreen_appkit` strong override in `cocoametal_window.m`. No ABI change (additive impl behind an existing v2 key). |
| 10 | **Live present FILLS the drawable (§2a-4)** — the user-reported fullscreen "small white rect" fix: the `CAMetalLayer` tracks the content view (backing layer + geometry hooks + fullscreen delegate + `cm_present` resync), the present aspect-fits with a **black** letterbox (default `CM_SCALE_ASPECT_FIT`), backgrounds black | John | ✅ `make cocoametal-livedraw` → `[LIVE] PASS`; the **live-drawable readback** (oracle was blind) asserts drawable == content-view backing size + the scene fills the aspect-fit content rect + letterbox black, **windowed AND fullscreen**. Plus `make cocoametal-show` (persistent human-facing look). Host-only; `CM_SCALE_ASPECT_FIT=3` appended (append-only, no `cm_*` symbol moved) — `hosted/cocoametal/{cocoametal,cocoametal_window}.m` + `livedraw_test.m` + `show.m`. |
| A | `arch/all-darwin/hidd/cocoa/` — `CocoaGfx`/`CocoaBM`, `HostLib_Open`+`GetInterface`, `UpdateRect→cm_present`, `Show→cm_open`, `CreateObject` injects `aHidd_BitMap_ClassPtr` | me | ☐ — starts after the CLI prompt is banked. Host reference: §2a call-mapping table + `[HIDDSIM]` |
| B | Input kbd/mouse hardware drivers consuming `CMEvent` | me | ☐ — also the interactivity hedge for the console. **Host side ready:** `cm_pump_events` is now REAL (`make cocoametal-input` → `[D4D5] PASS`; mouse + keyboard CMEvents asserted field-exact, in-process synthetic injection, no TCC — §5 note) |
| C | `AddDisplayDriverA` + pixfmt/sync/mode taglists; kickstart/monitor integration | me | ☐ |

D1/D2 host shim already proven green (`run/d1-`, `d2-cocoametal.png`). **The seam
items 1–3 (+ 6, 7, 9) are now green** (`[ABI] PASS` at v2, `[D2t] PASS`, `[SET] PASS`,
`[FS] PASS`, `build/cocoametal.dylib` exports all 13 `cm_*`): the dylib loads via
`dlopen`+`dlsym` with `errcount==0`, the ABI version handshakes, the §6 oracle is
exact, and `cm_open`/`cm_present`/`cm_pump_events`/`cm_open_settings`/the real
`CM_OPT_FULLSCREEN` toggle run under the real main-pthread/manual-CFRunLoop model
(no `NSApplicationMain`). **The last open host-side display item — real fullscreen —
is now closed** (item 9, §9f; with the documented "EXIT needs the app run loop"
finding the graft must honor). D3 (rows A–C) is now pure wiring against this
contract.

---

## 9. Settings & options — FROZEN (added at v2)

A native host **settings panel** plus a **key/value option ABI**. The split is the
contract: the **host** owns presentation (effect/scale/fullscreen/filter) and acts
on those immediately; **AROS** owns everything functional (mode, keymap, volume),
which the panel can only *request* — surfaced to the AROS side as a pull event,
never acted on by the host (keeps §3's no-callbacks-into-AROS rule).

### 9a. The three new calls (entries 10/11/12, append-only)

- `int cm_set_option(CMContext*, int key, long value)` — set an option.
  **Host-acted keys** take effect immediately on the **live present only** (never
  the offscreen oracle — the oracle stays pass-through/nearest per §6).
  **AROS-facing keys** are **not acted on**: the shim records the requested value
  (so `cm_get_option`/the panel can show it) and **enqueues a `CM_EV_SETTING`**.
  Returns 0 on success, nonzero for an unknown key / out-of-range value.
- `int cm_get_option(CMContext*, int key, long *value)` — read the current
  host-side value (host-acted keys = the live value; AROS-facing keys = the
  last-requested value). 0 / nonzero(unknown key).
- `int cm_open_settings(CMContext*)` — open the native AppKit panel, best-effort,
  on the display-server task under the manual `CFRunLoop` (like `cm_open`'s
  window). Idempotent (re-fronts if already up); degrades to a **no-op returning
  nonzero** with no window server. Non-blocking.

### 9b. The `CMOption` keys (numbered with gaps so each group grows independently)

| Key | Value | Group | Host behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CM_OPT_EFFECT` = 0x00 | a `CMEffect` (`CM_FX_*`) | **host-acted** | sets the present-time effect (== `cm_set_effect`) |
| `CM_OPT_SCALE_MODE` = 0x01 | a `CMScaleMode` | **host-acted** | live-present viewport: `ASPECT_FIT` (**default** — aspect-preserving fill, largest centred rect of the logical aspect, **black** letterbox; §2a-4) / `FIT` (stretch) / `INTEGER_NEAREST` (largest integer multiple, centred) / `PIXEL_PERFECT` (1:1, centred). `ASPECT_FIT` = `3` was **appended** at `[LIVE]` (append-only; the oracle is unaffected — §6) |
| `CM_OPT_FULLSCREEN` = 0x02 | 0/1 | **host-acted** | **REAL** native AppKit fullscreen: `1` → `-[NSWindow toggleFullScreen:]` (enter), `0` → exit; the flag is also recorded/persisted. The request is **async + non-blocking** (§3): `cm_set_option` issues the toggle and returns; the present path keeps composing to whatever the live drawable becomes. (Was a stored-flag stub through `[SET]`; made real at `[FS]`.) |
| `CM_OPT_FILTER` = 0x03 | a `CMFilter` | **host-acted** | live-present sampler: `NEAREST` / `LINEAR` (oracle stays nearest) |
| 0x04–0x0F | — | reserved (host) | future host-acted keys |
| `CM_OPT_REQUEST_MODE_W` = 0x10 | width px | **AROS-facing (stub)** | NOT acted on → `CM_EV_SETTING` |
| `CM_OPT_REQUEST_MODE_H` = 0x11 | height px | **AROS-facing (stub)** | NOT acted on → `CM_EV_SETTING` (paired with W) |
| `CM_OPT_KEYMAP` = 0x12 | keymap id | **AROS-facing (stub)** | NOT acted on → `CM_EV_SETTING` |
| `CM_OPT_AUDIO_VOLUME` = 0x13 | 0..100 | **AROS-facing (stub)** | NOT acted on → `CM_EV_SETTING` |
| 0x14+ | — | reserved (AROS) | future AROS-facing keys |

### 9c. The `CM_EV_SETTING` contract (pull surface; §5 append)

Appended to `CMEventType` **after `CM_EV_RESIZE`** (append-only). Emitted by
`cm_pump_events` when the user changed an AROS-facing setting (panel or a direct
`cm_set_option` of an AROS-facing key). **Packing:**

- `code` = the `CMOption` key,
- `x` = the new value (e.g. `CM_OPT_REQUEST_MODE_W` → width),
- `y` = a 2nd value when the key carries a pair (e.g. `CM_OPT_REQUEST_MODE_H`
  carries height in `x` **and the partner width in `y`** so the AROS side gets a
  complete W×H), else 0,
- `pressed` = 0, `mods` = 0 (unused).

**Pull-only:** the shim never calls into AROS — it enqueues, the AROS side drains
via `cm_pump_events` exactly like input (§5). Settings events are drained ahead of
NSEvents in the same `cm_pump_events` call, in the AppKit-free TU, so a **headless**
build (no window server) still delivers them.

### 9d. The panel + persistence

`hosted/cocoametal/cocoametal_settings.m` — a native `NSWindow` with controls for
the host-owned settings (scanline effect on/off, scale-mode popup, fullscreen
checkbox, filter popup) wired to `cm_set_option`, plus an AROS-owned resolution
popup that routes through `cm_set_option(CM_OPT_REQUEST_MODE_W/H)` (i.e. only ever
enqueues `CM_EV_SETTING` — never changes resolution itself). Host-owned state is
**persisted via `NSUserDefaults`** under `cocoametal.*` keys: **loaded + applied at
`cm_open`** (`cm__apply_persisted_options`, a strong override; weak no-op headless)
and **saved on every change** in the control actions. The AROS-facing requests are
transient and **not** persisted. The panel lives on the single display-server /
main thread (§3), under the same hand-pumped `CFRunLoop` proven at D2t, and is a
strong override of a weak stub so the AppKit-free TU pulls no AppKit headers.

### 9e. Verification — `[SET] PASS` (`make cocoametal-settings`)

`hosted/cocoametal/settings_test.m`, under the D2t threading model, asserts:
- **host-acted**: `cm_set_option(CM_OPT_EFFECT, CM_FX_SCANLINE)` → `cm_present` →
  the **presented** path reflects the effect (odd target rows darker, via
  `cm_render_effect_readback`) while the **offscreen oracle** (`cm_readback`) is
  byte-for-byte pass-through unchanged; `cm_get_option` reflects it.
- **AROS-pull**: `cm_set_option(CM_OPT_REQUEST_MODE_W=640, _H=512)` → host did NOT
  act (`cm_target_size` unchanged) → `cm_pump_events` returns two `CM_EV_SETTING`
  events carrying the keys/values (H event carries the paired W in `y`).
- **persistence**: seed `NSUserDefaults`, simulate a reopen (fresh `cm_open`
  re-reads + applies the defaults), assert the four host options restored; cleans
  the test keys afterward.

### 9f. `CM_OPT_FULLSCREEN` is now REAL — `[FS] PASS` (`make cocoametal-fullscreen`)

**Done (2026-06-25, John — `[FS]` green).** `cm_set_option(CM_OPT_FULLSCREEN,1)`
now enters **REAL native AppKit fullscreen** via `-[NSWindow toggleFullScreen:]`
(no longer a stored-flag stub); `0` exits. Implementation:

- The live window is created with `NSWindowCollectionBehaviorFullScreenPrimary`
  (`cocoametal_window.m`) so it can take over its own Space on a toggle — without
  it the window only "zooms" and `styleMask` never gains
  `NSWindowStyleMaskFullScreen`.
- `cm_set_option(CM_OPT_FULLSCREEN,v)` records/persists the flag (as before, so
  `cm_get_option`/the panel reflect it) **then** calls a strong override
  `cm__set_fullscreen_appkit(cx, v)` (`cocoametal_window.m`; weak no-op in
  `cocoametal.m` for the headless / no-AppKit / no-window build — same weak/strong
  split as `cm_try_window`/`cm_pump_events`). The override reads the window's
  **current** `styleMask & NSWindowStyleMaskFullScreen` and only issues the toggle
  when it differs from the request (`-toggleFullScreen:` is an UNCONDITIONAL
  toggle, so this makes `cm_set_option` idempotent). It is **async + non-blocking
  (§3):** it requests the (animated) transition and returns at once — no `cm_*`
  blocks waiting for the animation.
- The present path is unchanged plumbing: `cm_present` already reads
  `d.texture.width/height` per frame, so a now-fullscreen drawable upscales
  correctly with no extra code. The **offscreen oracle is untouched** by fullscreen
  (§6) — it is byte-exact across the whole enter→present→exit sequence (asserted at
  `[FS]`).

**THE HAND-PUMPED-`toggleFullScreen:` FINDING (this Mac, M-series / macOS 26.5, GUI
session, the backgrounded CLI test harness) — the answer the graft needs:**

- **ENTER works hand-pumped.** Under exactly the §3/D2t model (main pthread, manual
  `CFRunLoopRunInMode(kCFRunLoopDefaultMode, 0, true)`, **no** `NSApplicationMain` /
  **no** `[NSApp run]`), `toggleFullScreen:` enter flips
  `styleMask & NSWindowStyleMaskFullScreen` to set **essentially at the toggle call
  (0 extra pump iterations observed)** — that bit is the authoritative "fullscreen
  now" signal and the test asserts on it. The on-screen Space animation itself is
  driven by the window server.
- **EXIT needs the APP run loop.** Bare hand-pumping (even an aggressive
  NSEvent-drain + `CFRunLoopRunInMode(...,timeout=0.02)` loop) **never** clears the
  fullscreen bit — AppKit's fullscreen *exit* state machine only advances when the
  **app run loop** runs. The `[FS]` test therefore drives a **bounded `[NSApp run]`
  stopped by a watchdog timer** purely to observe the completed exit
  deterministically; **the production shim never does this** (it stays non-blocking
  per §3). **Graft consequence:** the display-server task's hand-pumped loop will
  enter fullscreen fine, but to *exit* cleanly it must either (a) spin a **bounded**
  `[NSApp run]` for the transition (stopped on the `windowDidExitFullScreen:`
  delegate or a deadline), or (b) accept that exit lands on a later real pump cycle.
  This is a property of AppKit, not the shim.
- **Backgrounded non-frontmost CLI quirk (test-harness only).** A bare CLI binary
  launched in the background (`run-hosted.sh` runs it with `&`) cannot become the
  **active/frontmost app** (`NSApp.isActive == 0` even after
  `activateIgnoringOtherApps:`/`TransformProcessType`), so the **first** exit toggle
  can be a no-op; the `[FS]` driver retries the toggle once and exit is then
  deterministic across runs. The graft's display-server runs as a proper app in the
  user's session (frontmost-capable), so this retry is a harness artifact, not a
  shim requirement. The `window.frame == screen.frame` geometry is **not** a
  reliable "is fullscreen" oracle in this process context (the fullscreen window
  keeps a windowed-looking frame) — `styleMask & NSWindowStyleMaskFullScreen` is the
  authoritative bit and the one `[FS]` asserts.

**Headless:** with no window server `cm__set_fullscreen_appkit` is a no-op (the flag
is merely recorded, as before) and `[FS]` skips the window asserts but still asserts
the oracle, so a headless run passes. The settings panel still degrades to a no-op
(returns nonzero) in a headless launch context, same caveat as `cm_open`'s window
(§3).

## 10. Dynamic display modes — added at v3

One new entry, appended per §7: `cm_set_mode(cx, w, h)` (symbol 13) reconfigures
the logical framebuffer **in place**: the upload ring and the offscreen oracle are
recreated at `w x h` and the live window's content area is resized to match
(skipped in fullscreen, where the present path letterboxes the new mode). The next
`cm_upload_rect` must deliver a full frame of the new size. Any-thread callable
(main-thread hop inside); returns 0 on success.

The full loop, both directions:

- **Host -> AROS** (Settings panel resolution popup, end of a user window drag
  via `windowDidEndLiveResize`, or the control FIFO `R w h`): the host calls
  `cm_set_option(CM_OPT_REQUEST_MODE_W/H)`; the pair reaches AROS as
  `CM_EV_SETTING` (§9). The cocoa HIDD's mode process snaps the request to the
  nearest database mode (`BestModeIDA`) and writes `ENV:SYS/screenmode.prefs`;
  IPrefs is notified and intuition reopens the Workbench screen. Requires IPrefs
  (the desktop startup path) — without it the request is written but nothing
  reopens the screen.
- **AROS -> host** (ScreenMode Preferences "Use", or any screen opened in a new
  mode): the driver's `Show()` sees a front bitmap whose size differs from the
  current mode and calls `cm_set_mode`; the window resizes to the new mode.

The AROS side registers a 16-mode ladder (800x600 first = the boot default;
640x480 up to 2560x1600). A drag snaps to the nearest ladder mode.

The main window is user-resizable from v3 (`NSWindowStyleMaskResizable`,
min 640x480 content). During a live drag the present path scales
(`CM_OPT_SCALE_MODE`); the mode change lands at drag end.

Resize-drag button handling (the "drag rectangle after every resize" bug): a
resize grab's `LeftMouseDown` is translated for the guest, but forwarding it to
`[NSApp sendEvent:]` blocks for the whole drag inside AppKit's modal
live-resize tracking loop. So the event drain must (1) put the translated
CMEvent in the ring BEFORE the `sendEvent:` forward, otherwise the grab's DOWN
is filed after everything the session generates and the guest sees `UP, UP,
DOWN` and arms a lasso with nothing to cancel it; and (2) stand down entirely
while `window.inLiveResize`, so it does not steal the drag events the session
needs. `windowWillStartLiveResize` / `windowDidEndLiveResize` also synthesize a
`LeftMouseUp` into the ring as belt-and-braces; an unmatched release is a no-op
for the guest.
